Postmortem: Outage Incident - Unexpected Feline Intrusion

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 10, 2023, 15:00 WAT to June 11, 2023, 03:00 WAT
Impact: Temporary service disruption for 15% of users accessing our web application.

Root Cause:
An unexpected feline intrusion caused a cascade of issues that resulted in the outage. A mischievous cat named Whiskers managed to infiltrate the data center, causing a series of unplanned events.

Timeline:

15:00: Issue detected when a monitoring alert indicated an abnormal increase in server response time.
15:10: Initial assumption was a potential distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack due to the sudden surge in traffic.
15:30: Investigation began by analyzing network traffic patterns and checking server logs.
16:00: It was noticed that certain servers were behaving erratically, with CPU and memory utilization spiking.
16:30: Further investigation revealed that an unidentified object was obstructing the server rack ventilation system.
17:00: Security footage showed the presence of a cat near the server rack.
17:30: Incident was escalated to the Data Center Operations team to locate and remove the intruding cat.
18:00: Whiskers was safely captured and removed from the data center.
18:30: Server performance started to stabilize, but the web application remained inaccessible for affected users.
20:00: Extensive testing was conducted to ensure that all systems were functioning properly.
03:00: The web application was fully restored, and all users regained access.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was the intrusion of Whiskers, the mischievous cat, into the data center. The cat's presence obstructed the server rack ventilation, resulting in overheating and subsequent performance degradation. To resolve the issue, the cat was safely captured and removed from the data center. Additionally, all affected servers were thoroughly inspected and cleaned to ensure proper functionality.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

Enhance physical security: Strengthen access controls to the data center to prevent unauthorized entry.
Improve environmental monitoring: Install additional sensors to detect changes in temperature and humidity levels within the data center.
Redesign ventilation system: Evaluate and modify the server rack ventilation system to prevent obstructions that may impact server performance.
Develop incident response protocol: Establish clear procedures for handling unexpected events, such as intrusions or environmental issues.
Employee education: Educate data center staff on the importance of maintaining a secure and controlled environment.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Install access control systems at the data center entrance.
Deploy additional environmental sensors to monitor temperature and humidity levels.
Conduct a thorough assessment of the ventilation system and make necessary modifications.
Develop an incident response protocol and provide training to relevant teams.
Schedule regular maintenance to inspect and clean server racks.
Perform a comprehensive review of physical security measures across all data centers.
In conclusion, the unexpected feline intrusion caused a temporary disruption in our web application service. The root cause was identified as an obstructed server rack ventilation system due to the presence of a mischievous cat. To prevent similar incidents, we will enhance physical security measures, improve environmental monitoring, and establish proper incident response protocols. By addressing these tasks, we aim to maintain a secure and reliable service for our users, free from feline-induced interruptions.
